> Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two larger numbers.

### Solution

```
(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (sum-square x y)
  (+ (square x)(square y)))

(define (fun x y z)
  (cond ((and (<= x y)(<= x z)) (sum-square y z))
        ((and (<= y x)(<= y z)) (sum-square x z))
        (else                   (sum-square x y))))
```
