> Below is a sequence of expressions. What is the result printed by the interpreter in response to each expression? Assume that the sequence is to be evaluated in the order in which it is presented.

```
10
(+ 5 3 4)
(- 9 1)
(/ 6 2)
(+ (* 2 4 (- 4 6)))
(define a 3)
(define b (+ a 1))
(+ a b (* a b))
(= a b)
(if (and (> b a) (< b (* a b)))
    b
    a)
(cond ((= a 4) 6)
      ((= b 4) (+ 6 7 a))
      (else 25))
(+ 2 (if (> b a) b a))
(* (cond ((> a b) a)))
```

### Answers

```
10
=> 10
```

A value expression evaluates to itself.

```
(- 9 1)
=> 8
(/ 6 2)
=> 3
(+ (* 2 4 (- 4 6)))
=> -16
```

Arithmetic expressions evaluate to the result of the operations. The last expression is not `16`, since adding nothing to `-16` is still `-16`.

```
(define a 3)
(define b (+ a 1))
```

Define expressions don't cause the interpreter to print anything.

```
(+ a b (* a b))
=> 19
```

The values 3 and 4 were previously assigned to the symbols `a` and `b`. The expression is just arithmetic.

```
(= a b)
=> #f
```

This expression evaluates to `#f` (false) since 3 is not equal to 4.

```
(if (and (> b a) (< b (* a b)))
    b
    a)
=> 4
```

Since 4 is larger than 3 and 4 is less than the product of 3 and 4, this expression evalutes to 4.

```
(cond ((= a 4) 6)
      ((= b 4) (+ 6 7 a))
      (else 25))
=> 16
```

Since `a` is not equal to 4, the first condition fails. The second predicate is true (`b` is equal to 4), so the expression evaluates to the result of `(+ 6 7 a)`, which is the sum of 6, 7 and 3.

```
(+ 2 (if (> b a) b a))
=> 6
```

Since `b` is larger than `a`, this expression evaluates to the sum of 2 and the value of `b`.
