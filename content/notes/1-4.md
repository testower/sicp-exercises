> Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

```
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

### Solution

To evaluate the combination

```
(a-plus-abs-b 5 -10)
```

we would first retrieve the body of `a-plus-abs-b` and replace the formal paramaters `a` and `b` with `5` and `-10`:

```
((if (> -10 0) + -) 5 -10)
```

Then we need to evaluate the new combination, whose operands are already primitive values, but the operator is a compound expression. Since -10 is not larger than 0, the operator reduces to `-`:

```
(- 5 -10)
=> 15
```
