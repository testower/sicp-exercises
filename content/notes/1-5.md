> Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

    (define (p) (p))

    (define (test x y)
      (if (= x 0)
          0
          y))

> Then he evaluates the expression

    (test 0 (p))

> What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)


### Solution

A normal-order evaluation tells us til "fully expand and then reduce", as opposed to "evaluate the arguments and then apply" which describe applicative-order evaluation. In the latter, since `(p)` evalutes to itself, the interpreter would enter into an infinite loop. In the former, the interpreter would simply print `0`, since `x = 0`, and the `y` parameter would never be evaluated.
